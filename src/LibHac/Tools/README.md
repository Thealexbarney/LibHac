# LibHac.Tools
The `LibHac.Tools` namespace contains classes that aren't necessarily part of Horizon. Some examples might include:
- Classes that provide additional functionality to that found in nnsdk.
- Classes that have a more user-friendly or C#-like API than those in nnsdk. e.g. A standalone NCA reader that streamlines opening and reading an NCA file.
- File parsers that read a file's structure into standard C# objects/fields instead of operating on a raw byte array.
